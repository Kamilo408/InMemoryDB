# In-Memory Database with Transactions

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.

2. **Get the Code**: Download or clone

main.py

 file to a folder on your computer.

3. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal**:

   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt.
   - **Mac/Linux**: Open Terminal.

4. **Go to the Folder**: Change the directory to where you saved 

main.py

:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/folder
   ```

5. **Run the Program**: Type this command and press Enter:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will run the program and show how the in-memory database works with transactions.

## Suggestions to Improve the Assignment

To make this assignment better in the future:

- **Clear Error Messages**: Make sure it's clear when methods like `commit()` or 

rollback()

 should give an error if there is no transaction happening.

- **Add More Functions**: Include more methods, like `delete(key)`, to let users remove keys during a transaction.

- **Provide Tests**: Give some test cases or a test file so students can check if their code works correctly. This makes grading easier.

- **Simplify Grading**: Use automated tests to check the code. This saves time and ensures consistency in grading.

- **Better Instructions**: Add more details to the instructions to help students understand what is expected. Clear guidelines make it easier for everyone.
